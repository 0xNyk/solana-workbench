Work on Solana more easily in your local environment and gain access to lots
of other fun tricks too.

## Deps

- Docker
- Yarn
- Anchor CLI must be available in PATH to use Anchor stuff

## Run

install native deps:

(I had to use https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32827756/npm-install-errors-which-one-to-focus-on to get Apple Command Line Tools for XCode to actually work)

```
$ cd release/app && yarn
```

install top level deps:

```
```

run:

```
$ npm run-script start
```

Now you're working with Workbench!
